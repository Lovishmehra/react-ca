        question: "How often should I exercise?",
        answer: "For beginners, start with 3-4 days a week to allow your body to adapt. Once you build a routine, aim for 5-6 days of exercise, alternating between strength and cardio to maximize results."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
        answer: "The best time to work out is when you feel most energized. For some, it's early morning; for others, it's after work. The key is consistency‚Äîfind a time that fits your lifestyle."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How long should my workouts be?",
        answer: "A typical workout session should last 45 minutes to an hour. This includes a warm-up, main workout, and cool-down. Short on time? A 20-minute high-intensity session can also be effective!"
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Warming up increases blood flow, loosens muscles, and reduces the risk of injury. Spend 5-10 minutes doing light cardio and dynamic stretches before every session."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
        answer: "A mix of both is ideal. Cardio improves heart health and endurance, while strength training builds muscle and boosts metabolism. Combine them to achieve a balanced fitness routine."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
        answer: "Yes! Weightlifting helps build muscle and improves overall strength. Start with light weights to focus on form, and gradually increase as your strength improves."
